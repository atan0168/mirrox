# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Solution Overview

### 1. **Made Authentication Optional by Default**

- Updated User model to include security preferences
- Modified LocalStorageService to not require authentication by default

### 2. **Updated Authentication Flow**

- Added `isAuthenticationRequired()` method to check user preferences
- Modified `authenticateUser()` to only prompt when authentication is enabled
- Created separate keychain entries for encryption key vs authentication

### 3. **Enhanced Splash Screen**

- Added authentication status tracking
- Prevents data fetching until authentication completes (if required)
- Added retry mechanism for failed authentication
- Shows user-friendly retry button on auth failure

### 4. **Created Settings Screen**

- New SettingsScreen component for configuring security preferences
- Toggle for enabling/disabling authentication
- Options for different authentication methods (biometric, PIN, both)
- Added to navigation with settings button in Dashboard header

## Authentication Flow

1. **App Launch**: Check if authentication is required
2. **If Not Required**: Proceed normally (default behavior)
3. **If Required**: Prompt for biometric/PIN before data access
4. **On Success**: Load user data and navigate to Dashboard
5. **On Failure**: Show retry option, don't proceed

## User Experience

- **First-time users**: No authentication required by default
- **Settings access**: Can enable authentication later via Dashboard settings
- **Failed authentication**: Clear feedback with retry option
- **Flexible options**: Choose between biometric, PIN, or both

## Security Benefits

- Data encryption is maintained regardless of authentication setting
- Authentication adds an extra layer of protection when enabled
- User controls when to enable additional security
- Graceful handling of authentication failures
